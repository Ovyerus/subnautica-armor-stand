# Subnautica Armour Stand

A mod for Subnautica that adds an armour stand used for storing & displaying the various dive suits in the game.

**CURRENTLY VERY HEAVY WIP**.

## TODO
- Implement saving (currently contents aren't persistent)
- Custom model (currently using trash can model)
- Display currently stored suits in the world, - figure out how to get "equipped" models for the suits if possible, otherwise turn into a display case sort of thing with default world models.
- Also perhaps let people pick up items without having to enter its inventory.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to [PrimeSonic](https://github.com/PrimeSonic) for providing an example of storage using SMLHelper.
